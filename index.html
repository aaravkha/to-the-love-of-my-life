    I don‚Äôt say this often maybe because words have never been my strongest language. I think you already know that. But if I could put it into something tangible, it would be this. Click below to see twenty-three reasons why i love you. Not in order of importance, but in the order they come to me whenever i think of you.

  <h1>Happy Birthday, Sayang ü§ç</h1>
  <p style="white-space: pre-line; margin-top: 20px;">
    Happy birthday, sayang.
    We‚Äôve grown, we‚Äôve changed, we‚Äôve been tested. 
    But every version of us, no matter how far apart or how close, you‚Äôre still the one I want beside me and I think I always will. 

    Lastly, maybe I don‚Äôt have big words, or some dramatic way to say it. I just really love being next to you, seeing you, knowing you‚Äôre there.  That‚Äôs enough for me and I hope you always know that‚Äôs what I mean when I say I love you.

    ‚Äî Khalil

    "Because you‚Äôre still the one who loves gently. Never loud, never showy, just constant, steady, the kind that stays even when the noise fades.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one who never tried to fix me. You just stayed, quietly, and somehow that was enough to make me want to heal on my own.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one who makes me believe that softness and strength can exist in the same person.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one who doesn‚Äôt let the world harden you. You still look at things with that kind of wonder I lost a long time ago.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one who brings life into everything repetitive. With you, even routines feel like something worth living for.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one who makes me want to become a better man, not out of pressure, but because you make being better feel possible.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one I reach for when things get quiet. My mind could be a thousand miles away, but somehow it always finds its way back to you.",
    "Because you‚Äôre still the one I trust the most, with my thoughts, my fears, my quiet dreams. All of it.",
